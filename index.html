                                                   <br><strong>Email Address:</strong> s3589170@student.rmit.edu.au<br>
                                                   <br><strong>Nationality:</strong> Australian (Sicilian Heritage)<br>
                                                   <br><strong>Education & Work:</strong> I graduated High School in 2010, since then I have had tried my hand at 4 different degrees (Engineering, I.T., Building Design & Industrial Design respectively). I have also worked at an IGA, as a driver for a home doctoring service, a I.T. technician for the defence force, a call centre operator, barista, bartender and assistant project manager.<br>
                                                   <br><strong>Interesting Hobby:</strong> I have always found 3D printing very interesting, so I bought myself a $300 make it yourself ANET A8 3D printer which I have slowly been modifying over the past year. Although it has been great so far, I am hoping to sell this one soon so that I can upgrade to a new and more stable 3D printer. </p>

                                                <span><strong>Interest in I.T.</strong></span>
                                                <p> My main interest in I.T. would have to be gaming. Iâ€™ve loved gaming since I was young boy playing my brothers original NES. Since then I have always played games and tried to keep up with the latest games as a hobby rather than an obsession. I was also very fascinated with how computers worked from a young as well, playing around with different settings and downloading lots of different programs to see what I could achieve with them. Since then I have always kept an interest in the area. I studied I.T. for one year at university then had a job as an I.T. Technician contracting to the Defence Force for a while and then worked for Telstra in the Platinum Department as a call centre operator. Since then I have also done a few subjects in the Industrial Design degree which have involved working with Arduino, Particle, Max MSP & Processing.
                                                I have studying at RMIT for almost 4 years now, I started out in Building Design, then transferred to Industrial Design and have now started back up with I.T. again. I am moving back to my hometown at the end of the year to study on campus at James Cook University in Townsville, so I am doing these subjects to gain credits for their Core subjects.
                                                During my studies I am hoping to complete a minor in Gaming Design so being able to create games on a basic level would be amazing but I am also hoping that I can learn a lot about how the industry works and the way that I.T. companies are able to collaboratively work together in an everchanging society. I am also hoping to learn a lot about software/app development.</p>

                                              <span><strong>Ideal Job</strong></span>
                                              <p>The closest job I could find wasnâ€™t at a Senior level but at a Junior level instead. The job describes the position as a Software Engineer that would help with gaming systems, tools, features and infrastructure. Being able design, write, debug and refine these skills would be essential for the candidate as they would have to give technical insights regarding the online design and implementation of the games that they are developing. It is appealing to me because it has a combination of creativity, maths, programming and being involved with teams that prototype, develop and refine some of the top rated games worldwide.
                                              They require someone that has had some programming experience (Iâ€™m assuming 1 year outside of graduation), with a great deal of understanding in C/C++ language, data structures, networking, system architecture and computer games technology. They also must have a strong passion for video games with a qualification in Computer Science or something that is equivalent.
                                              I currently have basic knowledge in Java, Python, Arduino, Processing and Max MSP programming languages. I also have a basic understanding of networking protocols and IT hardware setup. I have had experience in the IT industry as a trainee and call centre operator. I currently have no qualifications that would be relevant to this job type.
                                              To gain an opportunity to apply for this position I would have to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology and minor or major in Computer Science or something similar. I would have to pick electives that would best suit this type of job such as gaming design, software/system architecture, C/C++ programming, network security, etc.

                                                  <br>Based on the results from the three tests, I believe that I like to be in a secure environment and responsible for my own actions which can lead me to be driven to achieve what is necessary. I like to work away at thinks slowly and have a lot of visual aids and material in front of me so I can learn as mush as possible. Iâ€™m also persistent in that way I will try and achieve a goal, especially if it almost close to being perfect. I think that these traits could work well in a team environment but could also be at a disadvantage. If someone else doesnâ€™t do something that I might see fit, then I may comment on that. I may also try to take lead on the project and do more work than the others so that I can get the result that I want. In the past when I have had group assignments, I have taken these things into account and listened to other group members explanations and ideas. Another method I have found useful is that we all create a system that delegates all the work evenly so that everyone knows what must be done and by when.

Student will be required to place â€˜building blocksâ€™ of different square and rectangular sizes onto a blank board. This board will be the layout for the students to build characters and different level types. Once the student is happy with the layout of their character or level, they will then take a photo of the layout on an app. This app will gather the image and transfer it into an editable game creator where the students can assign different textures, features and animations to their character or level. Once theses features have been applied students can then test the level or game they have created being able to go back and edit any part of the game where they see fit.</p>

It was not until I had grown up with these new and emerging technologies that I became fascinated with them, especially gaming. I know that if I was given the opportunity as a child (age 7-12) to have experience with this sort of technology in a rural community, I would have had started to pursue my career in I.T. then rather than waiting until I was a few years out of high school.</p></div>

                                                                  <p><strong>The Physical</strong><br>
                                                                    Students will have access to a blank, black board (canvas) which will be where they can physically create their characters and levels. The board will be a 20 x 20 board consisting of 1-centimetre squares. Each square will contain a small circular extrusion so that the â€˜building blocksâ€™ can be locked into them, like Lego bricks but not as tight fitting. The â€˜building blocks' will also be made like Lego bricks but will be a lot flatter and can easily be placed onto the black canvas and just as easily be removed/moved around if necessary. Each square will have a 1-millimetre gap so that when a photo of the canvas is taken the app will be able to determine where the blocks will need to be placed for creation. All building blocks will be of different sizes which will vary from 1x1 all the way to 5x5 and be in a range of colours. There will be a certain number of black 1x1 block which will have a symbol on them, these will be allocated for â€˜character blocksâ€™ which will be placed when creating a level. This is to help the students physically place the character while building the level.
                                                                    <br><br><strong>The Digital</strong><br>
                                                                    Once the student/s have completed a character or level they will then take a photo using an app that that has been designed to analyse the image and determine where all the building blocks are and make a digital copy of the canvas layout. Student will have to choose whether they are creating a character or level so that they can save them in the appropriate editing format. Once the canvas has been loaded the student/s will be able to assign different textures or features to each block. The game can be as small or as large as the students want. This would accessible in the level making component of the app where students can add a new canvas â€˜imageâ€™ in any direction from where they have previously created part of that level. If they wish to make a different level with new features, harder bosses, different textures, etc., they would then have to go back in the app and create a new level. The students will be able to access a particular part of the level to test it out before trying to run the full game that way they can see if there is anything that will not work. Once they have tested all part of a level, they can then run through it and when all levels have been finished, they can then test the full game. Once the game is complete and â€˜bug freeâ€™ they can share it on a cloud service which will allow other users of the system to download and play the games as well. Primarily the software would be run on either an iOS or Android system on a tablet.
                                                                   <br><br><strong>Team Dynamic</strong><br>
                                                                    Students will have to work in groups of three to work on a game of their choice. They have free range to be able to make up a storyline, characters and levels so that they can code and create their game. The three different areas in which students will work in are: creating levels, creating characters and managing the coding. The idea is to let each student take turns at trying different things while collaboratively trying to create a game that not only they will enjoy but all their classmates as well.

                                                                          <p><strong>Tools & Technologies</strong><br>
                                                                            The software for this app would have to be developed at a high level because the user will, essentially, need to be able to â€˜codeâ€™ their own game. Although they will not be doing any hard coding, there will need to be an attention to detail about how the user interacts with the system and is able to navigate through it without any confusion and easy instructions. The hardware will need to be made so that it is precise so that the blocks can easily be placed and removed from the blank canvas board. This may require injection moulding if the game was going to be mass produced but in the preliminary stages of testing a 3D printer would suffice for physical parts.
                                                                            <br><br><strong>Skills Required</strong><br>
                                                                            Having the right people for this type of project are essential because it would have to be designed in a way that is both adult and kid friendly. One, because the kids will have to interact with the software and the physical elements of the game maker but also because the teachers will then have to try and relay all this information back to the children so that they can learn quickly and efficiently. An app designer as well as a games designer would be essential for app that needs to be created. A UI designer would be able to help with the interactively and flow of the app. For the purposes of testing stages of this project a skilled 3D printing expert would also be needed to help with the manufacture of the blank canvas board and all the building blocks.
                                                                           <br><br><strong>Outcome</strong><br>
                                                                            The outcome of this would be that schools/children who are in remote areas would be able to have access to a cheap and effective way of engaging in game development skills and give them a basic understanding of how we can use Tangible media to create something wonderful. If the first stage of this were successful, the next stage would be to increase the difficulty of â€˜game makingâ€™. All the basic elements would still be the same, like putting the building blocks onto a physical canvas and transferring that to digital platform, but the difficultly of the coding might be changed. Instead of having a UI that does all of that for you students will be able to manually write in code for certain things until they are ready to create a full digital game from scratch.
